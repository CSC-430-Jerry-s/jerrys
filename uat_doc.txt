1 Introduction
 
This User Acceptance Test document describes the testing setup, sample data, and the steps used to check whether the Jerry’s Streetwear application meets the agreed upon requirements. The purpose of UAT is to make sure the website works the way the users expect before it goes live. During this process, testers follow planned steps, record their results, and decide if the system should be accepted as-is or if some changes are needed before the release. This report is meant for the UAT team, the development group, and anyone involved in reviewing the results.
 
2 Test Environment
 
All testing was done in a controlled environment that is separate from the production version of the site. The frontend ran on a local Vite development server using React, while the backend used a Node.js and Express server connected to a PostgreSQL test database hosted on Render. Supabase test keys were used for login and authentication. This environment allowed us to control the data, reset the database when needed, and repeat tests under the same conditions. The setup is similar to what the production system will use, so the results are reliable.
 
3 Test Data Set
 
The test data included a mix of sample users, products, and orders that represent normal activity on the website. We prepared test users with and without saved addresses to check different checkout paths. Products included drop items, seasonal pieces, and regular basics so we could test all catalog types. Each product had several variants to confirm that size and stock updates behaved correctly. The dataset also included sample orders and shipments to test the order-tracking. All test data could be reset so results were consistent across multiple runs.
 
4 Exception Report
 
When anything unexpected happened during testing, the tester filled out an exception report. Each report included the date, the tester’s name, the test case and script number, the data used, and a clear explanation of the issue. These reports help the team understand what went wrong and whether the problem needs to be fixed before moving forward.
 
5 UAT Test Result Review
 
After we finished running all the tests, our group went through the results together and compared what happened to what we expected. We reviewed each test script, talked through any issues that showed up, and checked the exception reports to make sure we understood why certain problems happened. As a group, we agreed on which parts of the system worked well and which parts still need fixes before we consider the project “complete.” At the end of the review, we wrote a short summary of our findings and agreed on whether the system is acceptable in its current state or if changes are needed first.
